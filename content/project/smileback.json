Working closely with our team, I produced designs and assets for each of the app's views and associated states, iterating and refining every pixel in response to analytics, user interviews and internal discussion.",

In order to work efficiently and maintain consistency across thousands of interface elements, I built a detailed system of Sketch symbols that increased the speed and precision of mockups and specifications.\n2. I came up with a reliable technique for using symbols and constraints to generate artboards for both iOS and Android simultaneously, so we could push changes to Zeplin for painless handoff.\n3. To personalize users' experience geographically as a unique selling point, I designed an illustration for each city and college in which we launched.",
