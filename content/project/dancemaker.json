      "body": "Working hand-in-hand with students, teachers and administrators, I led the concept and development of an app for 92Y Dance Education Laboratory (DEL) to advance their mission of bringing dance into every New York City classroom.\n\nI carefully guided the project from concept to implementation by facilitating user research, iterating through a series of interactive prototypes, modeling and developing a content database, designing a visual identity with cross-platform mobile interfaces, overseeing development, and leading app-related professional development classes for the community.",

      "body": "### The great unknown\n\nThis was a project largely without precedent. In order to workshop its hypothetical features with the community, we devised approachable entry-points and clear boundaries for the conceptual space so everyone involved felt comfortable to engage and contribute.\n\n### Boots, meet straps\n\nOur shoestring budget necessitated a creative approach to interactions and content strategy. We sought efficient solutions to each objective without negatively impacting the quality of user experience or design polish.",

      "heading": "Establishing context",
      "body": "DEL provides dance education training to teachers and students, empowering them to design and lead lessons for many kinds of classrooms and studios. \n\nThe DEL model is built with a clear structure and rationale, which I interpreted into a proposal for digital interaction through a process of research and collaboration.",

      "body": "At the onset of our design process, we worked with a panel of professional advisors to establish goals and determine avenues of concern. I led a series of discussions where we whittled an extensive proposal down to a clear, purposeful scope.\n\nThe most important change we made was to reduce the features of our  MVP, focusing in on the “exploration” and “development” components of DEL's 7-part lesson structure. We made this change for two reasons: \n\n1. Teachers each have a unique way of working on and running lessons so it’s unlikely a turn-key lesson building walkthrough would satisfy most of our users.\n2. Reducing complexity in this case increases flexibility of application, an especially significant gain for an app designed to expand creative thinking and encourage imagination.",

      "heading": "Exploring a click-a-bout",
      "body": "I assembled a series of wireframes and interactive prototypes to communicate the flow of interaction through several primary funnels. These funnels were meant to address the needs of our educator personas. \n\nAs our research evolved, I adjusted these prototypes to re-prioritize touchpoints, mitigate pain points and reinforce the underlying principles of DEL’s method.",

    {
      "heading": "Oblique Strategies",
      "body": "As the application’s features began to coalesce, I noticed a pattern to learning that reminded me of something I’d experimented with before, Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt’s [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies). _Strategies_ presents a method of encouraging lateral thinking by subverting the prototypical relationships among ideas and actions. In other words, it helps us break out of our usual ways of thinking.\n\nI put two and two together and sketched out a feature called the “Idea Machine” that would source thought exercises from the DEL community as an extension of the app’s main workflow.\n\nWhen I presented the feature to our team, we realized it could incorporate suggestions from the [NYC DoE Blueprint for Dance](https://www.weteachnyc.org/resources/resource/dance-blueprint-for-teaching-and-learning/), a document we'd been working to incorporate somehow.\n\nThe resulting module offered a novel, non-linear way for teachers to brainstorm institutionally validated lesson objectives for a given K-12 age cohort.\n\n![Three screenshots depicting the tips and tricks feature (originally idea machine)](https://ucarecdn.com/5235c8ab-b0fd-4e24-94a6-92504f50fdf1/ \"Tips and tricks\")",

      "heading": "Building content",
      "body": "After arriving at specifications for a minimum viable product, I extrapolated placeholders into an information architecture with a supporting content strategy the community could engage with.\n\nWorking directly with students and teachers, I built out a database of vocabulary terms and converted existing materials into a format our interface would be able to understand.\n\nI also produced basic documentation and schedules for content generation, with guidelines meant to scaffold on DEL’s programs and professional development courses.",

      "heading": "Painting with pixels",
      "body": "Borrowing from DEL’s visual identity, I came up with a set of basic principles that would define the app’s look & feel. I conformed our wireframes to this style in a Sketch file for developers to reference. \n\nI designed a preliminary logo and app icon for DEL to provide feedback on. Subsequent discussions gave me the clarity I needed to produce a more refined icon. The result drew inspiration from a Laban Movement Analysis chart, one of the conceptual cornerstones to DEL’s methodology.",

    {
      "heading": "Implementation",
      "body": "What we lacked in resources we made up for with an ambition to do more with less. I worked closely with our developer throughout the implementation stage to clarify and revise almost every detail of the application, from custom algorithms to pixel polish.\n\nTogether we were able to build a native iOS app on a firebase backend that responded live to content updates, worked reliably across a variety of devices and generated the analytics we would need to provide meaningful improvements over the product’s life.",

I led a variety of exercises and discussions around the intentions and techniques of using the app before and during class. \n\nWe consolidated feedback and first impressions, brainstormed next-steps and considered the implications of the product at both the individual and systemic level.",

      "body": "We built something useful that students and teachers around the country understand and enjoy using. By grounding the experience in clear written language, we also found a way to expand the audience of the underlying concepts and increase engagement with DEL’s pedagogy.\n\nUnexpectedly, teachers of ELL students (English Language Learners) have shared their success using the app to build on language concepts during creative exercises, suggesting new possibilities for the future.\n\nDancemaker is available on iOS and Android. It’s been featured in the press (eg. [Broadway World](https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/92Y-Unveils-Free-Dance-Maker-Choreography-App-20170918)) and was incorporated into [an exhibit at the Children’s Museum of Manhattan](https://cmom.org/press/cmom-press-release-childrens-museum-of-manhattan-announces-opening-of-lets-dance/).",
