      "heading": "Summary",
      "body": "Working hand-in-hand with students, teachers and administrators, I led the concept and development of an app for 92Y Dance Education Laboratory (DEL) to advance their mission of bringing dance into every New York City classroom.\n\nI carefully guided the entire project from concept to implementation by facilitating user research, iterating through a series of interactive prototypes, modeling and developing a content database, designing a visual identity with cross-platform mobile interfaces, overseeing development, and leading app-related professional development classes for the community."

    {
      "heading": "Challenges",
      "body": "1. The app we were tasked with designing was without precedent. In order to workshop its hypothetical functionality with an eager community, we devised approachable entry-points and clear boundaries for the conceptual space so everyone involved felt comfortable to engage and contribute.\n2. Our shoestring budget necessitated a creative approach to interactions and content strategy. We sought efficient solutions to each objective without negatively impacting the quality of user experience or design polish."

    {
      "heading": "Outcomes",
      "body": "We built something useful that students and teachers around the country understand and enjoy using. By grounding the experience in clear language, we also found a way to expand the audience of the underlying concepts and increase engagement with DEL’s pedagogy.\n\nDancemaker is available on iOS and Android. It’s been featured in some press and was incorporated into an exhibit at the Children’s Museum of Manhattan."
