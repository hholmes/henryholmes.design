      "body": "Working hand-in-hand with students, teachers and administrators, I led the concept and development of an app for 92Y Dance Education Laboratory (DEL) to advance their mission of bringing dance into every New York City classroom.\n\nI carefully guided the project from concept to implementation by facilitating user research, iterating through a series of interactive prototypes, modeling and developing a content database, designing a visual identity with cross-platform mobile interfaces, overseeing development, and leading app-related professional development classes for the community.",

      "body": "### The great unknown\n\nThis was a project largely without precedent. In order to workshop its hypothetical features with the community, we devised approachable entry-points and clear boundaries for the conceptual space so everyone involved felt comfortable to engage and contribute.\n\n### Boots, meet straps\n\nOur shoestring budget necessitated a creative approach to interactions and content strategy. We sought efficient solutions to each objective without negatively impacting the quality of user experience or design polish.",

By grounding the experience in clear written language, we also found a way to expand the audience of the underlying concepts and increase engagement with DEL’s pedagogy.\n\nUnexpectedly, teachers of ELL students (English Language Learners) have shared their success using the app to build on language concepts during creative exercises, suggesting new possibilities for the future.\n\nDancemaker is available on iOS and Android. It’s been featured in the press ([Broadway World](https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/92Y-Unveils-Free-Dance-Maker-Choreography-App-20170918)) and was incorporated into [an exhibit at the Children’s Museum of Manhattan](https://cmom.org/press/cmom-press-release-childrens-museum-of-manhattan-announces-opening-of-lets-dance/).",
