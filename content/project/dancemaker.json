In order to workshop its hypothetical features with the community, we devised approachable entry-points and clear boundaries for the conceptual space so everyone involved felt comfortable to engage and contribute.\n\n### Boots, meet straps\n\nOur shoestring budget necessitated a creative approach to interactions and content strategy. We sought efficient solutions to each objective without negatively impacting the quality of user experience or design polish.",

      "body": "At the onset of our design process, we worked with a panel of professional advisors to establish goals and determine avenues of concern. I led a series of discussions where we whittled an extensive proposal down to a clear, purposeful scope.\n\nThe most important change we made was to reduce the features of our  MVP, focusing in on the “exploration” and “development” components of DEL's 7-part lesson structure. We made this change for two reasons: \n\n1. Teachers each have a unique way of working on and running lessons so it’s unlikely a turn-key lesson building walkthrough would satisfy most of our users.\n2. Reducing complexity in this case increases flexibility of application, an especially significant gain for an app designed to expand creative thinking and encourage imagination.",

These funnels were meant to address the needs of our educator personas. \n\nAs our research evolved, I adjusted these prototypes to re-prioritize touchpoints, mitigate pain points and reinforce the underlying principles of DEL’s method. \n\nWe used [Invision](https://invisionapp.com) to share clickable prototypes with the team, which made for easy updates and pain-free behavior demonstrations.\n\n![A grid of 16 plain UI screens](https://ucarecdn.com/9d5d2bc0-526e-4e2c-ad20-6d26633558a9/ \"Views from an early MVP prototype\")\n\n![A colorful grid of 11 different UI screens](https://ucarecdn.com/f1e4a6b8-9798-4b29-b32e-1ec2bf46502e/ \"Views from a prototype exploring new content\")",

In other words, it helps us break out of our usual ways of thinking.\n\nI put two and two together and sketched out a feature called the “Idea Machine” that would source thought exercises from the DEL community as an extension of the app’s main workflow.\n\nWhen I presented the feature to our team, we realized it could incorporate suggestions from the [NYC DoE Blueprint for Dance](https://www.weteachnyc.org/resources/resource/dance-blueprint-for-teaching-and-learning/), a document we'd been working to incorporate somehow.\n\nThe resulting module offered a novel, non-linear way for teachers to brainstorm institutionally validated lesson objectives for a given K-12 age cohort.\n\n![Three screenshots depicting the tips and tricks feature (originally idea machine)](https://ucarecdn.com/5235c8ab-b0fd-4e24-94a6-92504f50fdf1/ \"Tips and tricks\")",

We held sessions at 92Y to brainstorm hundreds of action words and categories for the 'movement sentences' feature. This was also an opportunity to share our prototype with a broader group of teachers and discuss their impressions.\n\nSubsequent the brainstorming sessions, I wrote python scripts to generate JSON documents from plaintext lists and CSV exports and uploaded everything to [Firebase](http://firebase.com) for easy API access. \n\n![Screenshot of portions of 3 spreadsheets](https://ucarecdn.com/f30c7d8f-ae9c-4add-93c9-75c2cf98cecd/ \"Organizing content\")\n\n```{ title=\"Basic data processing script\" }\nimport csv\nimport json\nimport itertools\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom time import gmtime, strftime\n\ndata = {}\nwith open('sources/dance-maker.json') as json_data:\n   data = json.load(json_data)\n\t\n# ------------------------\n#    Actions & Themes\n# ------------------------\nthemes = {}\nactions = {}\nwith open('sources/vocab.csv') as vocabCSV:\n   action_items = csv.reader(vocabCSV, delimiter=',')\n   for row in action_items:\n      theme = row[0]\n      themes[row[0]] = {'description' : row[0], 'tags' : [ row[0] ]}\n      for x in row[1:]:\n         if x > \"\":\n            if x in actions:\n               actions[x]['topics'][row[0]] = True\n            else:\n               actions[x] = {'topics': { row[0] : True }}\ndata['action-topics'] = themes\ndata['action-words'] = actions\n\n# ------------------------\n#        Resources\n# ------------------------\nresources = []\nwith open('sources/resources.csv') as resourcesCSV:\n   bookmarks = csv.DictReader(resourcesCSV, delimiter=',')\n   for row in bookmarks:\n      resources.append(row)\ndata['bookmarks'] = resources\n\n# ------------------------\n#      Idea Prompts\n# ------------------------\ncategories = {}\ncategoryKeys = []\nwith open('sources/idea-categories.csv') as categoriesCSV:\n   cats = csv.DictReader(categoriesCSV, delimiter=',')\n   for row in cats:\n      if int(row['count']) > 0:\n         categories[row['key']] = { 'name' : row['category'], 'description' : row['description']}\n         categoryKeys.append(row['key'])\ndata['idea-categories'] = categories\ndata['magic-8-categories'] = categories\n\nideas = []\nwith open('sources/ideas.csv') as ideasCSV:\n   next(ideasCSV)\n   prompts = csv.reader(ideasCSV, delimiter=',')      \n   for row in prompts:\n      p = {\n         \"text\" : row[0],\n         \"attr\" : row[1],\n         \"categories\" : {}\n      }\n      for count, c in enumerate(row[2:]):\n         if c == 'TRUE':\n            p['categories'][categoryKeys[count]] = True\n      ideas.append(p)\ndata['ideas'] = ideas\ndata['magic-8'] = ideas\n\nactionsFile = open('actions.txt', 'w')\nfor action in actions:\n   actionsFile.write(\"%s\\n\" % action)\n\nfilename = 'exports/dance-maker-' + strftime(\"%d-%m_%H-%M\",gmtime()) + '.json'\nwith open(filename, 'w') as outFile:\n   json.dump(data, outFile)\n```\n\nI also produced documentation and schedules for content generation, with guidelines meant to scaffold on DEL’s programs and professional development courses.\n\n![Six pages from a document describing how to manage content in the app](https://ucarecdn.com/dea8a1a9-d8c7-4bbc-b848-fe56324e366a/ \"Basic content strategy documentation\")",

I conformed our wireframes to this style in a Sketch file for developers to reference. \n\nI designed a preliminary logo and app icon for DEL to provide feedback on. Subsequent discussions gave me the clarity I needed to produce a more refined icon. The result drew inspiration from a Laban Movement Analysis chart, one of the conceptual cornerstones to DEL’s methodology.\n\n![A lateral series of progressively more complex icons](https://ucarecdn.com/2d3618f9-8537-4dce-b809-cead1685ac3b/ \"Design progression for the updated icon\")",

After some testing and design updates, we followed up with an Android app that incorporated  learnings from the initial release and conformed the UI to [Material guidelines](https://material.io).\n\n### Pseudocode\n\nWe discovered a mismatch between how our movement exploration \"shuffle\" function worked compared to user expectations. Teachers we spoke with said they prefer to scaffold their lessons in a linear way, progressing from less challenging descriptors of _Body_ and _Space_ before moving into _Effort_ qualities and _Relationships_. Our completely random function was a usability trap for inexperienced users to fall into.\n\nWe didn't have sufficient resources to rebuild, so I sat down and figured out an efficient solution. What I produced was an algorithm that added weight to the shuffle behavior to retain a sense of unpredictability while favoring the foundational categories.",

I led a variety of exercises and discussions around the intentions and techniques of using the app before and during class. We consolidated feedback and first impressions, brainstormed next-steps and considered the implications of the product at both the individual and systemic level.\n\nSharing the project with students, dancers and educators was an awesome, invigorating experience. Collaborative insights quickly emerged as we worked together to make dances. I was reassured in the value of exploration in any creative endeavor, because the best moments in these workshops emerged when a group of open minded people tried something new and challenging together.\n\n<div class=\"my-rhythm1/2x\" style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/cIbiftO6XPoyX3HbjD\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n\nWe built something useful that students and teachers around the country understand and enjoy using. By grounding the experience in clear written language, we also found a way to expand the audience of the underlying concepts and increase engagement with DEL’s pedagogy.\n\nUnexpectedly, teachers of ELL students (English Language Learners) have shared their success using the app to build on language concepts during creative exercises, suggesting new possibilities for the future.\n\nDancemaker is available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dancemaker/id1180809091) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dancemaker.android).
