      "body": "I was a core member of the small team tasked with building the National Park Service official mobile app. I provided direction and deliverables across the full scope of the project from piloting and prototypes to deployment and maintenance. \n\nIn order to produce a framework that could adapt reliably to the needs of 300 million annual visitors across more than 400 sites nationwide we built a flexible content model and editor, facilitating high quality contributions from hundreds of park rangers around the country.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/henryholmesdesign/image/upload/v1567541531/Park%20Mobile/compass.svg){ .section-break }",

      "body": "### Experience at scale\n\nAbsent a mature content and data API from the Park Service, each instance of the app would require a new set of contributors from the relevant parks who would need to create and organize a fresh dataset and content package. Our response was twofold: on the backend I scaffolded UX fieldwork into a robust editor model that could be translated into a CMS; on the frontend I helped to polish the interface and reinforce visual patterns that could adapt to a wide variety of content types and image qualities without compromising the overarching Park Mobile and NPS brands.\n\n### Data (and other deserts)\n\nGiven the remoteness and extreme conditions in most national parks, we knew to expect significant challenges around connectivity and byte-budgeting. This was only exacerbated by a lackluster CDN beyond our control and wildly inconsistent data policies across the park system. We responded creatively with a myriad of compromises to mitigate visitor pain and re-center the core experience, included amplifying preparatory touchpoints in wifi-enabled locations, improving the clarity asynchronous interactions, and building resilient live features to deliver the freshest data possible at every turn.\n\n### Accessibility matters\n\nI was responsible for devising a proprietary indoor proximity system to deliver audio descriptions at visitor centers across the system in compliance with federal accessibility guidelines. In order to accomplish this within budget, I led the design and configuration of an iBeacon-enabled indoor exhibit module that could be adapted for a wide variety of physical spaces.",

      "body": "When I joined the project early deployment of a pilot app was already underway at a handful of parks. For the pilot there were several goals in mind:\n\n1. Learn how the park service thinks about its content. What is important to them? What do they think is important to visitors?\n2. Determine how the app will be adapted for parks of various types and sizes. What guidelines should shape the adoption process of individual managers and contributors?\n3. Formalize content strategies that will empower each park to tell their own story. What facets of the app should be universally required, as opposed to arbitrarily included on a case-by-case basis?\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/henryholmesdesign/image/upload/v1567548207/Park%20Mobile/icons/wood_log.svg){ .section-break }\n\n### Analyzing patterns\n\nIn order to align our process with the needs of park editors, we took a look at the content choices each was making. This gave us insight into their priorities and expectations, which informed the questions we brought into stakeholder interviews and design exercises.\n\n![A whiteboard depicting content types for 8 different parks](https://res.cloudinary.com/henryholmesdesign/image/upload/v1567546979/Park%20Mobile/per-park-ia.jpg \"Identifying content patterns\")",
