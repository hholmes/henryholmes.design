      "body": "I was a core member of the small team tasked with building the National Park Service official mobile app. I provided direction and deliverables across the full scope of the project from piloting and prototypes to deployment and maintenance. \n\nIn order to produce a framework that could adapt reliably to the needs of 300 million annual visitors across more than 400 sites nationwide we built a flexible content model and editor, facilitating high quality contributions from hundreds of park rangers around the country.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/henryholmesdesign/image/upload/v1567541531/Park%20Mobile/compass.svg){ .section-break }",

      "body": "### Experience at scale\n\nAbsent a mature content and data API from the Park Service, each instance of the app would require a new set of contributors from the relevant parks who would need to create and organize a fresh dataset and content package. Our response was twofold: on the backend I scaffolded UX fieldwork into a robust editor model that could be translated into a CMS; on the frontend I helped to polish the interface and reinforce visual patterns that could adapt to a wide variety of content types and image qualities without compromising the overarching Park Mobile and NPS brands.\n\n### Data (and other deserts)\n\nGiven the remoteness and extreme conditions in most national parks, we knew to expect significant challenges around connectivity and byte-budgeting. This was only exacerbated by a lackluster CDN beyond our control and wildly inconsistent data policies across the park system. We responded creatively with a myriad of compromises to mitigate visitor pain and re-center the core experience, included amplifying preparatory touchpoints in wifi-enabled locations, improving the clarity of asynchronous interactions, and building resilient live features to deliver the freshest data possible at every turn.\n\n### Accessibility matters\n\nI was responsible for devising a proprietary indoor proximity system to deliver audio descriptions at visitor centers across the system in compliance with federal accessibility guidelines. In order to accomplish this within budget, I led the design and configuration of an iBeacon-enabled indoor exhibit module that could be adapted for a wide variety of physical spaces.",

      "body": "When I joined the project early deployment of a pilot app was already underway at a handful of parks. For the pilot there were several goals in mind:\n\n1. **Learn how the park service thinks about its content.** What is important to them? What do they think is important to visitors?\n2. **Determine how the app will be adapted for parks of various types and sizes.** What guidelines should shape the adoption process of individual managers and contributors?\n3. **Formalize content strategies that will empower each park to set their own priorities.** What facets of the app should be universally required, as opposed to arbitrarily included on a case-by-case basis?\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/henryholmesdesign/image/upload/v1567548207/Park%20Mobile/icons/wood_log.svg){ .section-break }\n\n### Analyzing patterns\n\nIn order to align our process with the needs of park editors, we took a look at the content choices each was making for their pilot app. These insights informed our questions in stakeholder interviews and other design exercises.\n\n![A whiteboard depicting content types for 8 different parks](https://res.cloudinary.com/henryholmesdesign/image/upload/v1567546979/Park%20Mobile/per-park-ia.jpg \"Identifying content patterns\")\n\nIt was important to be mindful of how we were grouping content types because any assumptions we introduced (even implicitly) would have a ripple effect on how contributors thought about their role and imagined possibilities. While we needed explicit terms and categories to ground our conversations, I took extra precaution to encourage outside-the-box thinking and remind everyone to center their own perspectives â€” since unique, individualized expectations were exactly what we hoped to discover.\n\n![A list of content items at 10 different parks](https://res.cloudinary.com/henryholmesdesign/image/upload/v1567549063/Park%20Mobile/per%20park%20components.jpg \"Quantifying feature categories\")",

      "body": "\n\nIt was important to identify an appropriate interaction pattern for the app's home screen. The pilot had been designed to feature on the home page a prominent image from the park and recent news, with other elements hidden behind at least one or two taps. Based on the availability of relevant news and a shifting understanding of visitor priorities, we found the recent news feature less than relevant and we noticed the slideshow of other images from the park (which was accessed by tapping the main image,) was rarely viewed.\n\n![A screenshot of the Klondike National Historic Park pilot app](https://res.cloudinary.com/henryholmesdesign/image/upload/v1567551936/Park%20Mobile/klgo-home.jpg \"Pilot app home screen\")\n\nI sorted an expanded set of content types into buckets according to interaction methods, in order to understand how our new interface could be modeled.\n\n![A diagram of content types organized by discovery mode](https://res.cloudinary.com/henryholmesdesign/image/upload/v1567552960/Park%20Mobile/interaction-patterns.png \"Modes of discovery for various content\")\n\nTo increase flexibility across parks, we needed to make better use of the available screen real estate. This led us to a grid-based system, which could provide one-tap access to any number of content items or features. I helped to iteratively refine the home page by testing various arrangements and tiles, building color schemes, and identifying harmonious measurements for the layout.\n\n![A photo of whiteboard notes on the home page structure](https://res.cloudinary.com/henryholmesdesign/image/upload/v1567553152/Park%20Mobile/IMG_1305.jpg \"Developing home tile logic\")",
